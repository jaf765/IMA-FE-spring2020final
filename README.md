# plant-guide

This website is a tool to help anyone of any experience level find the right houseplant for them based on their answers to the quiz. It uses the API https://trefle.io/ 

Final project for NYU IMA Front-End Web Design

The API does not run on the github link because there isn't access to a server. Please vist http://jaf765.itp.io:3000/# to view the fully functioning website with quiz results from the API.
